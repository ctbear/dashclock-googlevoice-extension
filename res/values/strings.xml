    <string name="accessibility_desc">This accessibility service will allow the extension to be notified when a new Google Voice notification arrives.
 Since Google has not provided an API for Google Voice, this extension app requires an extra service to monitor new Google Voice notifications
 as well as when the Google Voice app is entered.\n\nNo personal data is captured and transmitted for other purposes.
 Note that this extension does not have permission to access Internet and other information
 such as SMS and Email.</string>
